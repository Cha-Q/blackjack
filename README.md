## Introduction

### Short explanation

A simple Blackjack game, that's all.  
There is a button to start the game. Each time you'll click on it, a function will select a random number wich is going to match a card.  
The first two sets of clicks are going to display the dealer's hand, the third and the fourth your hand.

## Project context

This exercise was part of my training. 
The only elements at our disposal were the instruction to make a blackjack game and the data set constituting the cards of the deck.
